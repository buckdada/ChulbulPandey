        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
           This website was created to promote inclusive learning and make educational content accessible to everyone. It is designed to support users with visual impairments, including those who are colorblind or rely on screen readers. By combining clear structure, thoughtful design, and user-friendly features, the site aims to provide a welcoming space where all learners can explore content comfortably and confidently.
       </p>
       <p>
           It was created as an educational resource to explore the origins and meanings of cultural festivals around the world. 
           Our goal is to make learning about global traditions engaging, informative, and easy to navigate.
         
           Whether you're a student, educator, or curious visitor, you'll find stories, timelines, and insights that reveal how festivals 
           reflect the history and values of the communities that celebrate them.

         <h2>Why Cultural Festivals?</h2>
         <p>
           Cultural festivals offer a unique lens into the stories, values, and traditions of communities around the world. 
           From seasonal rituals to historic commemorations, each festival reflects how people celebrate, remember, and connect.
         </p>
         <p>
           We chose this theme because festivals are both universal and deeply specific. They blend history, symbolism, and joy—
           making them a powerful way to explore culture in motion. By tracing their origins, we aim to highlight what makes each 
           tradition meaningful and how it continues to shape modern life.

         <h2>How the Project Started</h2>
         <p>
           Our team brainstormed topics that would be educational, visually engaging, and culturally rich. 
           We were drawn to festivals because they combine storytelling, history, and celebration—making them ideal for a site 
           that invites exploration and learning.
